Watch and Chill is a "toy" project for the husband and wife team of Jonathan and Marta to learn about modern cloud-based application architecture based on microservices.

Jonathan is a system administrator making a transition to cloud-native application environments. Marta is a C# programmer wanting to learn more about .NET v8, the Blazor web page framework, and using containers for application deployment.

Together we will build a small application that allows our friends and family to list the movies they are interested in watching, with the goal of finding others in the group that may want to watch them together.  Along the way we will apply principles of CI/CD, IaC, and GitOps to build a modern web-based application.

See the [repository Wiki](https://github.com/lago-morph/chiller/wiki) for significantly more detail.
